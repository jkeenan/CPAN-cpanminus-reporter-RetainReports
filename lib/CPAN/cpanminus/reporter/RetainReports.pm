CPAN::cpanminus::reporter::RetainReports - Retain reports on disk rather than transmitting them

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use CPAN::cpanminus::reporter::RetainReports;

    my $cpanmdir                        = '/home/username/.cpanm';
    my $log                             = "$cpanmdir/build.log";
    local $ENV{PERL_CPANM_HOME}         = $cpanmdir;
    local $ENV{PERL_CPAN_REPORTER_DIR}  = '/home/username/.cpanreporter';

    my $reporter = CPAN::cpanminus::reporter::RetainReports->new(
        force               => 1,           # ignore mtime check on cpanm build.log
        build_dir           => $cpanmdir,
        build_logfile       => $log,
        'ignore-versions' => 1,
    );

    my $analysisdir = '/home/username/bbc/testing/results/perl-5.27.0';
    $reporter->set_report_dir($analysisdir);
    $reporter->run;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This library parses the output of a F<build.log> generated by running
L<cpanm|http://search.cpan.org/~miyagawa/App-cpanminus-1.7043/bin/cpanm> and
writes the output of that parsing to disk for later analysis or processing.

This is B<alpha> code; the API is subject to change.

=head2 Rationale:  Who Should Use This Library?

This library is a subclass of Breno G. de Oliveira's CPAN library
L<App-cpanminus-reporter|http://search.cpan.org/~garu/App-cpanminus-reporter-0.17/>.
That library provides the utility program
F<cpanm-reporter|http://search.cpan.org/dist/App-cpanminus-reporter-0.17/bin/cpanm-reporter>
a way to generate and transmit CPANtesters reports after using Tatsuhiko
Miyagawa's
L<cpanm|http://search.cpan.org/~miyagawa/App-cpanminus-1.7043/bin/cpanm>
utility to install libraries from CPAN.

Like similar test reporting methodologies, F<App-cpanminus-reporter> does not
retain test reports on disk once they have been transmitted to
L<CPANtesters|http://www.cpantesters.org>.  Whether a particular module passed
or failed its tests is very quickly reported to
L<http://fast-matrix.cpantesters.org/> and, after a lag, the complete report
is posted to L<http://matrix.cpantesters.org/>.  That works fine under normal
circumstances, but if there are any technical problems with those websites the
person who ran the tests originally has no easy access to reports --
particularly to reports of failures.  Quick access to reports of test failures
is particularly valuable when testing a library against specific commits to
the Perl 5 core distribution and against Perl's monthly development releases.

This library is intended to provide at least a partial solution to that
problem.  It is intended for use by at least three different kinds of users:

=over 4

=item * People working on the Perl 5 core distribution or the Perl toolchain

These individuals (commonly known as the Perl 5 Porters (P5P) and the Perl
Toolchain Gang) often want to know the impact on the most commonly used CPAN
libraries of (a) a particular commit to Perl 5's master development branch
(known as I<blead>) or some other branch in the repository; or (b) a monthly
development release of F<perl> (5.27.1, 5.27.2, etc.).  After installing
blead, a branch or a monthly dev release, they often want to install hundreds
of modules at a time and inspect the results for breakage.

=item * CPAN library authors and maintainers

A diligent CPAN maintainer pays attention to whether her libraries are
building and testing properly against Perl 5 blead.  Such a maintainer can use
this library to get reports more quickly than waiting upon CPANtesters.

=item * People maintaining lists of CPAN libraries which they customarily install with F<perl>

Organizations which use many CPAN libraries in their production tend to keep a
curated list of them, often in a format like
L<cpanfile|http://search.cpan.org/~miyagawa/Module-CPANfile-1.1002/lib/cpanfile.pod>.
Those organizations can use this library to assess the impact of changes in
blead or a branch or of a monthly dev release on such a list.

=head1 METHODS

Not needed in current forumulation; inherited from F<App-cpanminus-reporter>.

        force               => 1,           # ignore mtime check on cpanm build.log
        build_dir           => $cpanmdir,
        build_logfile       => $log,
        'ignore-versions' => 1,

=head2 C<new()>


=over 4

=item * Purpose

F<CPAN::cpanminus::reporter::RetainReports> constructor.

=item * Arguments

    my $reporter = CPAN::cpanminus::reporter::RetainReports->new(
        force               => 1,
        build_dir           => $cpanmdir,
        build_logfile       => $log,
        'ignore-versions' => 1,
    );

Takes a list of key-value pairs or hash.  Keys may be any eligible for passing
to C<App::cpanminus::reporter::new()>.  Those shown have proven to be useful
for this library's author.

=item * Return Value

F<CPAN::cpanminus::reporter::RetainReports> object.

At this time it is thought that these two environmental variables should be
explicitly set if either the F<.cpanm> or the F<.cpanreporter> directory is in a
non-standard location, I<i.e.,> in a location other than directly under the
user's home directory.

    local $ENV{PERL_CPANM_HOME}         = '/home/username/.cpanm';
    local $ENV{PERL_CPAN_REPORTER_DIR}  = '/home/username/.cpanreporter';

=head2 C<set_report_dir()>

=over 4

=item * Purpose

Identify the directory to which reports will be written, creating it if needed.

=item * Arguments

    $reporter->set_report_dir($analysisdir);

String holding path to desired directory.

=item * Return Value

String holding path to desired directory.

    }
    $self->{report_dir} = $dir;

=head2 C<get_report_dir()>

=over 4

=item * Purpose

Identify the already created directory in which reports will be ridden.

=item * Arguments

    $self->get_report_dir();

None.

=item * Return Value

String holding path to relevant directory.

sub get_report_dir {

=head2 C<parse_uri()>

=over 4

=item * Purpose

While parsing a build log, parse a URI.

=item * Arguments

    $self->parse_uri("http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/J/JK/JKEENAN/Perl-Download-FTP-0.02.tar.gz");

String holding a URI such as the one above.

=item * Return Value

True value upon success; C<undef> otherwise.

=item * Comments

=over 4

=item * Stores the following attributes for a given CPAN distribution:

    distname        => 'Perl-Download-FTP'
    distversion     => '0.02'
    distfile        => 'JKEENAN/Perl-Download-FTP-0.02.tar.gz'
    author          => 'JKEENAN'

These attributes can subsequently be accessed via:

    $self->distname();
    $self->distversion();
    $self->distfile();
    $self->author();

=item * Limited to parsing these URI schemes:

    http https ftp cpan file

=item * Overwrites C<App::cpanminus::reporter::parse_uri()>.

=item *

See the F<examples/> directory for sample reports.

=item *

Inherited from C<App-cpanminus-reporter>.  However, whereas that library's
method composes and transmits a report to L<CPANtesters.org>, this library's
method generates a F<.json> report file for each distribution analyzed and retains
that on disk for subsequent processing or analysis.  As such, this is the
crucial difference between this library and F<App-cpanminus-reporter>.

=item *

In a later version of this library we will provide a more human-friendly,
plain-text version of the report.
