Revision history for Perl module CPAN::cpanminus::reporter::RetainReports

0.10 Fri Dec 29 21:30:37 EST 2017
    - Die in Makefile.PL if on Windows.

0.09 Fri Dec 22 11:22:48 EST 2017
    - Implement better syntax for path to perl executable, as suggested by
      Andreas Koenig.

0.08 Wed Dec 20 21:11:24 EST 2017
    - Add missing prerequisite Data::Dump for 'dump-parsed-cpanm-build-logs'

0.07 Wed Dec 20 17:31:08 EST 2017
    - Add helper program 'dump-parsed-cpanm-build-logs'

0.06 Fri Dec 15 14:36:40 EST 2017
    - Account for possible absence of 'author' in formation of name of .json
      files.

0.05 Fri Dec 15 12:33:18 EST 2017
    - Improve handling of 'file' scheme URIs, since the Metabase::Resource
      underlying App-cpanminus-reporter doesn't handle 'file' and hence cannot
      get a value for 'author' (which is also needed for composition of
      'distfile').

0.04 Tue Dec  5 09:44:15 EST 2017
    - Require recent version of App-cpanminus-reporter.  Older versions handle
      UNKNOWN/NA reports differently; CPANtesters using those older versions
      were generating FAILs in unit tests

0.03 Mon Dec  4 15:42:33 EST 2017
    - First CPAN release

0.02 Fri Dec 01 2017
    - [Not released to CPAN ]

0.01 Tue Nov 28 08:05:47 2017
    - original version; created by ExtUtils::ModuleMaker 0.56
    - [Not released to CPAN ]
